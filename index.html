                            Hi, I'm Ryan Stumbaugh, a senior at Pennsbury High School and aspiring software developer. Along with taking many programming courses at Pennsbury, I taught myself a lot about Java and computer science in general. Starting around the beginning of tenth grade, I began to get seriously interested in coding and spent countless hours researching new subjects and learning how to practically implement them in my code. This is a small portfolio of my most notable works, which were mostly done outside of school. While I have created many more projects and applications such as Pong, Blackjack, and Tron, I felt these two best showcase the skills I've learned. The projects are available to download but you must have Java installed on your computer for them to run. Thanks for reading and enjoy!

                        <p>A classic game for everyone: Battleship! Be the first to figure out where the enemy has hidden their ships. Play either single-player mode against a CPU or play against a friend via LAN.  This was my first major project and took around a year and a half to complete. Before starting Battleship, I knew little to nothing about making GUIs in Java and absolutely nothing about network I/O, so this project was a fun way to learn new skills. <br>(November 2012 - January 2014)</p><br>

                        <p>A fun, addictive single-player defense game. You must spawn soldiers and fire projectiles to try to destroy the enemy's castle before he destroys yours! Use gold to purchase upgrades and special items in the shop. In case you want to pick up where you left off, the game features save and load features as well. Working on this project taught me about both writing to and reading from XML files in Java along with creating my own custom GUI while still using Swing components. <br>(February 2014 - July 2014)</p><br>

                        <p>My current project: a WiFi sync app for Android devices. The user can sync their phone's music library with a directory on a local machine quickly and efficiently. Started in June 2014, there is no projected date for when the app will be done. Already I have learned more about networking with Java, modern web protocols and am currently learning about two-way syncing.<br><br>

                       <strong>CURRENT PROGRESS:</strong> implemented file transfer between client and server, working on sync algorithm</p><br>
